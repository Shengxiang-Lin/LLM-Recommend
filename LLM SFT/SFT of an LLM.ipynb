    "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
    "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
    "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",
    "* this notebook applies to any decoder-only LLM available in the Transformers library. In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B base model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), which is one of the best open-source large language models at the time of writing."

    "## Required hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to be run on any NVIDIA GPU which has the [Ampere architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_(microarchitecture)) or later with at least 24GB of RAM. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NVIDIA RTX 3090, 4090\n",
    "* NVIDIA A100, H100, H200\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. Personally I'm running the notebook on an RTX 4090 with 24GB of RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for an Ampere requirement is because we're going to use the [bfloat16 (bf16) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format), which is not supported on older architectures like Turing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But: a few tweaks can be made to train the model in float16 (fp16), which is supported by older GPUs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NVIDIA RTX 2080\n",
    "* NVIDIA Tesla T4\n",
    "* NVIDIA V100.\n",

    "Let's start by installing all the \ud83e\udd17 goodies we need to do supervised fine-tuning. We're going to use\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transformers for the LLM which we're going to fine-tune\n",
    "* Datasets for loading a SFT dataset from the \ud83e\udd17 hub, and preparing it for the model\n",
    "* BitsandBytes and PEFT for fine-tuning the model on consumer hardware, leveraging [Q-LoRa](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes), a technique which drastically reduces the compute requirements for fine-tuning\n",
    "* TRL, a [library](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index) which includes useful Trainer classes for LLM fine-tuning."

    "## Define model arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it's time to define the model arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, some explanation is required regarding ways to fine-tune model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that we will simply update all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (float32), or mixed precision (a combination of float32 and float16). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, float32 means that each parameter of a model gets saved in 32 bits or 4 bytes. Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM. And that's just for a 7B parameter model! See the guide for more info: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRa, a PEFT method\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, some clever people at Microsoft have come up with a method called [LoRa](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora) (low-rank adaptation). The idea here is that, rather than performing full fine-tuning, we are going to freeze the existing model and only add a few parameter weights to the model (called \"adapters\"), which we're going to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRa is what we call a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. It's a popular method for fine-tuning models in a parameter-efficient way, by only training a few adapters, keeping the existing model untouched. LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### QLoRa, an even more efficient method\n",
    "\n",
    "With regular LoRa, one would keep the base model in 32 or 16 bits in memory, and then train the parameter weights. However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it. There are various quantization methods available, here we're going to use the [BitsandBytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) integration.\n"

    "## Define SFTTrainer\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) available in the TRL library. This class inherits from the Trainer class available in the Transformers library, but is specifically optimized for supervised fine-tuning (instruction tuning). It can be used to train out-of-the-box on one or more GPUs, using [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) as backend.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As we're going to use QLoRa, the PEFT library provides a handy [LoraConfig](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/package_reference/lora#peft.LoraConfig) which defines on which layers of the base model to apply the adapters. One typically applies LoRa on the linear projection matrices of the attention layers of a Transformer. We then provide this configuration to the SFTTrainer class. The weights of the base model will be loaded as we specify the `model_id` (this requires some time).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also specify various hyperparameters regarding training, such as:\n",
    "* we're going to fine-tune for 1 epoch\n",
    "* the learning rate and its scheduler\n",
    "* we're going to use gradient checkpointing (yet another way to save memory during training)\n",
