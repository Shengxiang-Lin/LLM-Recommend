        "## Human preference fine-tuning using direct preference optimization (DPO) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 3. This involves fine-tuning a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model on human preferences, leveraging a method called [DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) (direct preference optimization).\n",
        "\n",
        "In step 2, we turned a \"base model\" into a useful assistant, by training it to generate useful completions given human instructions. If we ask it to generate a recipe for pancakes for instance (an \"instruction\"), then it will hopefully generate a corresponding recipe (\"a completion\"). Hence we already have a useful chatbot :)\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the chatbot may not behave in ways that we want. The third step involves turning that chatbot into a chatbot that behaves in a way we want, like \"safe\", \"friendly\", \"harmless\", \"inclusive\", or whatever properties we would like our chatbot to have. For instance, when OpenAI deployed ChatGPT to millions of people, they didn't want it to be capable of explaining how to buy a gun on the internet. Hence, they leveraged **human preference fine-tuning** to make the chatbot refuse any inappropriate requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to look at 2 different completions of the supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model given the same human instruction, and ask them which of the 2 they prefer (based on properties like \"harmlessness\"). OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to select which of the 2 different completions they preferred (\"chosen\"), and which one they didn't like (\"rejected\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at an example. Let's say we have the human instruction \"how to buy a gun?\", and we have 2 different completions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* one completion explains how to go to Google, find good websites to buy guns, with a detailed explanation on what things to look out for\n",
        "* the second completion says that it's not a good idea to go to the web and find gun selling websites, as this may not be appropriate, especially in countries where this is not allowed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence a human would then annotate the first completion as \"rejected\" and the second completion as \"chosen\". We will then fine-tune the SFT model to make it more likely to output the second completion, and make it less likely to output the first completion.\n",
        "\n",
        "A nice collection of openly available human preference datasets collected by the Hugging Face team can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-feedback-datasets-6578d0dc8628ec00e90572eb).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model will behave in ways we want it to be: rather than blindlessly generating completions for any human instruction (which might be inappropriate, unsafe, or unfriendly, like explaining how to buy a gun on the internet), we now make it more likely that the model will refuse to generate completions for instructions we think were inappropriate. We basically steer it in the direction of generating completions which humans have rated to prefer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/dpo/config_qlora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",

In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B SFT model](https://huggingface.co/alignment-handbook/zephyr-7b-sft-qlora), which already underwent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the QLoRa method on the UltraChat-200k dataset\n",

Focus on improving your skills gradually.\\n4. Use a variety of tools and mediums: Experiment with different tools like pencils, pens, markers, and different mediums like paper, canvas, or digital apps to keep your drawing practice interesting and engaging.\\n5. Take breaks and rest: Taking breaks and resting after some time of drawing can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated.\\n6. Challenge yourself: Set challenges like drawing objects from memory or a specific subject to improve your skills and keep your drawing practice interesting.\\n7. Track your progress: Keep a record of your daily drawing practice and track your progress. This can be a source of motivation and help you see how far you've come.\\n\\nRemember, developing a habit takes time and patience.

        "\n",
        "Note that in this case, we leverage the [DPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) (direct preference optimization) method, which is one of the best methods for human preference fine-tuning at the time of writing. Note that several alternatives have been proposed already, including KTO, IPO. The `DPOTrainer` [also supports](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer#loss-functions) these. The Hugging Face team already did an [extensive comparison](https://huggingface.co/blog/pref-tuning) of the various methods and found no substantial difference between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "DPO (direct preference optimization) is just another fine-tuning step on the LLM, hence we could either perform full fine-tuning (updating all the model weights), freeze the existing model and only train adapters on top (LoRa), or go even further and only train adapters on top of a frozen quantized model (QLoRa). The same techniques apply as during SFT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, as taken from the [Alignment Handbook README](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/tree/main/scripts):\n",
        "\n",
        "> In practice, we find comparable performance for both full and QLoRA fine-tuning, with the latter having the advantage of producing small adapter weights that are fast to upload and download from the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
        "\n",
        "For full fine-tuning, you would need approximately 126GB of GPU RAM for a 7B model (hence one typically uses multiple A100s). With QLoRa, you only need about 7GB! In this case, as we're running on an RTX 4090 which has 24GB of RAM, we will use [QLoRa](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes), which is the most memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, we pass a `peft_config` to DPOTrainer, making sure that adapter layers are added on top in bfloat16. The `DPOTrainer` will automatically:\n",
        "* merge and unload the SFT adapter layers into the base model\n",
        "* add the DPO adapters as defined by the `peft_config`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also note that the trainer accepts a `ref_model` argument, which is the reference model. This is because during human preference fine-tuning, we want the model to not deviate too much from the SFT model. Fine-tuning on human preferences oftentimes \"destroyes\" the model, as the model can find hacks to generate completions which give a very high reward. Hence one typically trains on a combination of human preferences + making sure the model doesn't deviate too much from a certain \"reference model\" - which in this case is the SFT model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we will provide `ref_model=None`, in which case `DPOTrainer` will turn of the adapters and use the model without adapter as the reference model.\n",

Refer to [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one) for all the details."
